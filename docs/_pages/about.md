I am experienced BI developer with more than 5 year experience in Business Intelligence. I spend most of my work live in supply chain and e-commerce doing analytics using Tableau, PowerBi, Excel etc. 

Currently I am working consultant in web programing projects as role of system and data analyst.

When i finish that project i hope to shift my operations into helping companies save money on BI by migrating Tableau, Power BI and similar dashboard reports to web application that will enhanced and streamline way people used this tool in past.

I call this type of system data driven process improvement/decision making applications that drive data culture and are unlimited in what can be done in term of collaboration, data inputs and process workflow - something which i found biggest bottle next of current state BI solutions. 

My experience in many sectors helps me quickly understand business environment of projects and what users may need. In my deliverables I put focus on clarity, simplicity, and accuracy.

I prefer organized environments for team working (ideally Scrum, Kanban), however when working individually I also enjoy to work in more VUCA-type environments.
