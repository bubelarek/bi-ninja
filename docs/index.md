BI-Ninja.com is my company which currently is focused on B2B cooperation in area of data analytics  and BA/PO. I am providing services in  topics related to  Business Intelligence / data driven applications.
 I future I plan to provide services that focus on rebuilding different kind of Tableau/Power BI dashboard as separate  need-tailored applications  that more cheaper to maintain and  better fit to what is needed. I have seen so many tools done by ‘brave hero people’  in Excel, Tableau PowerBI that should have been done differently. 
I call it BI-Ninja as in this area to succeed you need be nimble, flexible and fast - but as well as be sustainable. This suitability portion is easy to forgotten as it is not giving value right away but shows its power when comes to user adoption, monitoring and delivering benefits behind BI and times when people join/left organization.

## I hope from time to time post blog post about

* end-to-end BI work management 
* data modelling and preparation for faster dashboard and report making
* visual advices and tricks me and my team applied in real work
* how to learn BI especially to stop using complex Excel, VBA for reporting
