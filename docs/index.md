BI-Ninja.com is personal blog around topics related to  Business Intelligence. It will be based on my 5+ year experience in area and most recently struggles to lead BI developers team in sustainable and  organized way. I will focus on work of BI team not as series of small projects but as continues process of delivering reporting solution.

I call it BI-Ninja as in this area to succeed you need be nimble, flexible and fast - but as well as be sustainable in way this is achieved. This suitability portion is easy to forgotten as it is not giving value right away but shows its power when comes to user adoption, monitoring and delivering benefits behind BI and times when people join/left organization.
